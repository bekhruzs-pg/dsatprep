# DSAT English Roadmap: Path to 800

This roadmap is designed to guide students from their current level to a perfect 800 on the Digital SAT Reading and Writing section. It is structured to build a strong conceptual foundation in grammar and rhetoric, master reading comprehension strategies, and refine speed and accuracy for the hardest inference and vocabulary questions.

## 1. The DSAT English Landscape

### Structure
- **Two Modules**: Adaptive format. Module 1 (Mix of easy/medium/hard) determines the difficulty of Module 2.
- **Time**: 32 minutes per module.
- **Questions**: 27 questions per module (25 operational + 2 pretest).
- **Format**: Short passages (25-150 words) with one question per passage.

### The 4 Core Domains
1.  **Craft and Structure** (~28%): Vocabulary, Text Structure, Purpose, Cross-Text Connections.
2.  **Information and Ideas** (~26%): Central Ideas, Details, Command of Evidence, Inferences.
3.  **Standard English Conventions** (~26%): Grammar, Punctuation, Sentence Structure.
4.  **Expression of Ideas** (~20%): Transitions, Rhetorical Synthesis.

## 2. Phased Progression Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Grammar & Vocabulary)
*Goal: Master the objective rules of English and build a vocabulary bank.*
- **Focus**: Memorizing grammar rules (punctuation, verb tense) and high-frequency vocabulary.
- **Action**: Complete the "Standard English Conventions" checklist. Daily vocab practice.
- **Checkpoint**: 100% accuracy on Grammar questions. These are the "free points."

### Phase 2: Application (Reading Strategies)
*Goal: Develop a systematic approach for every reading question type.*
- **Focus**: Identifying question types (e.g., "Main Purpose" vs. "Inference") and applying specific strategies.
- **Action**: Practice drills by topic (untimed). Focus on *why* wrong answers are wrong.
- **Checkpoint**: >90% accuracy on "Easy" and "Medium" difficulty questions.

### Phase 3: Mastery (Logic & Evidence)
*Goal: Tackle the hardest logical reasoning and inference questions.*
- **Focus**: "Hard" difficulty questions, Command of Evidence, and subtle logical gaps.
- **Action**: Deep analysis of complex texts (scientific, historical).
- **Checkpoint**: >85% accuracy on "Hard" difficulty questions.

### Phase 4: The 800 Push (Speed & Perfection)
*Goal: Eliminate careless errors and master the "unsolvable".*
- **Focus**: Time management, strict Process of Elimination, maintaining focus.
- **Action**: Full-length timed practice tests. Analyze EVERY mistake.
- **Checkpoint**: Consistently scoring 760-800 on practice tests.

## 3. Domain Breakdown & Topic Checklist

### 🟦 Domain 1: Craft and Structure (Vocabulary & Analysis)
*Understanding how texts are built and what words mean in context.*

- [ ] **Words in Context**
    - Identifying the definition that fits the *specific* scenario.
    - Recognizing secondary meanings of common words.
    - **Strategy**: Plug in your own word first, then match.
- [ ] **Text Structure and Purpose**
    - Identifying the main purpose (Why did the author write this?).
    - Analyzing the structure (How does the text flow? e.g., Claim -> Evidence -> Counterclaim).
- [ ] **Cross-Text Connections**
    - Comparing two short texts on the same topic.
    - Identifying points of agreement or disagreement.

### 🟪 Domain 2: Information and Ideas (Comprehension & Logic)
*The "Reading" heavy questions. Logic is key.*

- [ ] **Central Ideas and Details**
    - Summarizing the main idea without getting distracted by details.
    - Finding specific details to support a claim.
- [ ] **Command of Evidence (Textual)**
    - Choosing the quote that best supports a specific argument.
    - **Strategy**: Identify the *exact* claim being made before looking at choices.
- [ ] **Command of Evidence (Quantitative)**
    - Interpreting graphs, tables, and charts.
    - Connecting data to the text's argument.
    - **Trap**: Answers that are true based on the graph but irrelevant to the argument.
- [ ] **Inferences**
    - Drawing logical conclusions based *only* on the text.
    - **Rule**: If it's not in the text, it's wrong. Avoid "leap of logic" answers.

### 🟧 Domain 3: Standard English Conventions (The Rules)
*These are mathematical. Learn the rules, get the points.*

- [ ] **Boundaries (Punctuation)**
    - **Periods & Semicolons**: Separate two independent clauses.
    - **Commas**: Lists, introductory phrases, non-essential clauses (appositives).
    - **Colons & Dashes**: Introduce lists, explanations, or emphasis.
- [ ] **Form, Structure, and Sense**
    - **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Singular subject = Singular verb.
    - **Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement**: Ensure pronouns match their nouns.
    - **Verb Tense**: Consistency within the timeline of the text.
    - **Parallel Structure**: Items in a list must match in form.
    - **Modifier Placement**: Dangling modifiers (the modifier must be next to what it modifies).

### 🟩 Domain 4: Expression of Ideas (Flow & Rhetoric)
*Improving how ideas are connected and presented.*

- [ ] **Transitions**
    - **Continuers**: Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally.
    - **Contradictors**: However, Nevertheless, Conversely.
    - **Cause & Effect**: Therefore, Thus, Consequently.
    - **Strategy**: Read the sentence *without* the transition to determine the relationship.
- [ ] **Rhetorical Synthesis**
    - Synthesizing notes into a sentence that achieves a specific goal.
    - **Strategy**: Focus purely on the *goal* stated in the prompt (e.g., "emphasize the student's achievement"). Ignore other interesting facts.

## 4. The "Literalism" Advantage (Secret Weapon)
*The SAT is a standardized test. It must be objective.*

1.  **The "One Flaw" Rule**: If any part of an answer choice is wrong, the *entire* choice is wrong.
2.  **No Outside Knowledge**: The answer is 100% contained within the text (or graph). Never use your own knowledge of the topic.
3.  **Strict Process of Elimination**: Don't look for the "right" answer; look for 3 demonstrably "wrong" answers.
    - *Too Extreme*: Words like "always," "never," "proven."
    - *Irrelevant*: True, but doesn't answer the question.
    - *Opposite*: Says the reverse of the text.
4.  **Grammar is Math**: There is no "it sounds good." There is only "it follows the rule."

## 5. Daily Routine for 800
- **Review**: 1 Grammar Rule or Question Type/Day (Phase 1).
- **Read**: Read 1 complex article (Scientific American, The Economist, etc.) daily to build stamina.
- **Practice**: 10-15 Questions/Day (Phase 2).
- **Analyze**: Review every mistake. Was it a vocab issue? A logic issue? A misread?
- **Mock Tests**: 1 Full Test every weekend (Phase 3 & 4).
