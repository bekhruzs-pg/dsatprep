# Statistics

## 1. Overview
Statistics involves analyzing data sets: finding the center (mean, median), spread (range, standard deviation), and understanding how sample data relates to populations. The DSAT tests conceptual understanding more than heavy calculation.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Mean (Average)**: $\frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}$
*   **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted. If even count, average the two middle values.
*   **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently.
*   **Range**: $\text{Max} - \text{Min}$
*   **Standard Deviation**: Measures the **spread** of data around the mean.
    *   Small SD: Data is clustered close to the mean.
    *   Large SD: Data is spread out.
*   **Margin of Error**: The uncertainty in a survey result. Larger sample = smaller margin.
*   **Random Sampling**: Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected (reduces bias).

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Identify What's Asked**: Mean? Median? Effect of outliers?
2.  **Organize Data**: Sort if finding median or range.
3.  **Calculate**: Use formulas or patterns.
4.  **Interpret Context**:
    *   "How does removing the outlier affect the mean?" (Outliers pull the mean but don't affect the median much.)
    *   "Which sampling method is best?" (Random sampling is usually the answer.)

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Mean vs. Median with Outliers**: An extreme value (outlier) drastically affects the mean but has little effect on the median.
*   **Sample Size**: A larger sample size decreases margin of error and increases reliability.
*   **SD vs. Range**: Range only uses two values (min/max). SD uses all values and is more informative.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: The data set is: 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 20. What is the median?

**Solution**:
1.  **Check if Sorted**: Already sorted.
2.  **Count Values**: 6 values (even count).
3.  **Find Middle Two**: The 3rd and 4th values are 4 and 6.
4.  **Average Them**: $\frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5$
5.  **Answer**: Median is 5.
