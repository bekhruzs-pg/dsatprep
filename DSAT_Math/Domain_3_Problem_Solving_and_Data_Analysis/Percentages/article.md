# Percentages

## 1. Overview
Percentages are everywhere on the DSAT: discounts, tax, interest, population growth. The key is translating percentage language ("20% of", "increased by 15%") into algebraic expressions. These questions are usually straightforward if you slow down and read carefully.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Percent**: "Per hundred". $50\% = \frac{50}{100} = 0.5$.
*   **Basic Formula**: $\text{Part} = \text{Percent} \times \text{Whole}$.
*   **Percent Change**: $\frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100\%$
*   **Percent Increase**: New Value $= \text{Old} \times (1 + r)$, where $r$ is the rate.
*   **Percent Decrease**: New Value $= \text{Old} \times (1 - r)$.

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Identify What You're Finding**: Is it the part, the whole, or the percent?
2.  **Convert Percent to Decimal**: Move the decimal two places left (e.g., $25\% = 0.25$).
3.  **Set up Equation**: Use "of" as multiplication, "is" as equals.
    *   "What is 20% of 80?" → $x = 0.20 \times 80$
4.  **Percent Change**: Be careful with the denominator—always use the **original** value.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Sequential Percent Changes**: A 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease does NOT return to the original. You end up at $1.10 \times 0.90 = 0.99$ (99% of original, not 100%).
*   **Confusing Part/Whole**: "15 is what percent of 60?" vs. "What is 15% of 60?" Read carefully.
*   **Forgetting to Multiply by 100**: When asked for "percent change", the final answer should be multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: A shirt originally costs $40. After a 25% discount, what is the sale price?

**Solution**:
1.  **Method 1 (Find Discount)**: 
    *   Discount $= 0.25 \times 40 = 10$
    *   Sale Price $= 40 - 10 = 30$
2.  **Method 2 (Direct)**:
    *   Sale Price $= 40 \times (1 - 0.25) = 40 \times 0.75 = 30$
3.  **Answer**: $30.
