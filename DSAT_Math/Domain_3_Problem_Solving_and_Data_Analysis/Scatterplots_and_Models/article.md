# Scatterplots & Models

## 1. Overview
Scatterplots visualize the relationship between two variables. The DSAT tests your ability to interpret trends, understand the line (or curve) of best fit, and make predictions. This topic bridges data analysis and algebra.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Line of Best Fit**: A line (or curve) that best represents the trend in the data.
*   **Slope Interpretation**: The rate of change. "For every increase of 1 in $x$, $y$ changes by $m$."
*   **Y-Intercept Interpretation**: The predicted value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
*   **Correlation**:
    *   **Positive**: As $x$ increases, $y$ increases.
    *   **Negative**: As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases.
    *   **No Correlation**: Random scatter, no clear pattern.
*   **Linear vs. Exponential**:
    *   Linear: Constant **addition** per unit (Graph is a straight line).
    *   Exponential: Constant **multiplication** per unit (Graph curves up or down).

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Read the Axes**: Identify what $x$ and $y$ represent (units and context).
2.  **Assess the Trend**: Is it going up (positive), down (negative), or flat (no correlation)?
3.  **Use the Model**: If given an equation like $y = 2.5x + 10$:
    *   Slope ($2.5$): For every 1 unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by 2.5.
    *   Y-intercept ($10$): When $x=0$, $y=10$.
4.  **Desmos for Regression**: If given data points, type them into a table and use $y_1 \sim mx_1 + b$ to find the line.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Extrapolation**: Predicting far beyond the data range. A linear model might not hold outside its scope.
*   **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Just because two variables are related doesn't mean one causes the other.
*   **Misreading Slope**: Forgetting the **units**. A slope of 5 could mean "$5 per hour" or "$5 per unit" depending on context.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: A scatterplot of hours studied ($x$) vs. test score ($y$) has a line of best fit $y = 8x + 50$. What does the slope represent?

**Solution**:
1.  **Identify Slope**: $m = 8$.
2.  **Interpret Context**: 
    *   $x$ = hours studied
    *   $y$ = test score
3.  **Meaning**: For every additional hour studied, the test score increases by **8 points**.
4.  **Answer**: The slope represents an 8-point increase in test score per additional hour of study.
