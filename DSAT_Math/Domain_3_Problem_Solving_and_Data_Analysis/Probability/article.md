# Probability

## 1. Overview
Probability asks "What is the likelihood of an event happening?" On the DSAT, these questions often involve simple scenarios (dice, cards, spinners) or two-way tables with conditional probability. The key is understanding the total number of outcomes.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Basic Probability**: $P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}}$
*   **Range**: Probability is always between 0 and 1 (or 0% to 100%).
    *   $P = 0$: Impossible.
    *   $P = 1$: Certain.
*   **Complement**: $P(\text{Not A}) = 1 - P(A)$.
*   **Conditional Probability**: $P(A | B) = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes in B}}{\text{Total outcomes in B}}$.
    *   "Given that B has happened, what is the probability of A?"

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Identify Sample Space**: What are ALL possible outcomes?
2.  **Count Favorable Outcomes**: How many of those outcomes meet the condition?
3.  **Divide**: $\frac{\text{Favorable}}{\text{Total}}$.
4.  **Two-Way Tables**: Read carefully. For conditional probability, focus only on the row/column that matches the "given" condition.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **With/Without Replacement**: Drawing without replacement changes the total. First draw: 52 cards. Second draw: 51 cards left.
*   **Reading Tables**: Mixing up rows and columns when calculating conditional probability.
*   **Multiplying vs. Adding**: "A AND B" usually means multiply probabilities (if independent). "A OR B" usually means add (if mutually exclusive).

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: A bag contains 3 red, 2 blue, and 5 green marbles. What is the probability of drawing a red marble?

**Solution**:
1.  **Total Marbles**: $3 + 2 + 5 = 10$
2.  **Favorable (Red)**: $3$
3.  **Probability**: $\frac{3}{10} = 0.3$ or $30\%$
4.  **Answer**: $\frac{3}{10}$ or $0.3$.
