# Equivalent Expressions

## 1. Overview
This topic tests your ability to rewrite algebraic expressions in different forms. You'll encounter polynomials, rational expressions, and exponents. The goal is often to simplify an expression or match it to one of the answer choices.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Exponent Rules**:
    *   $x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$
    *   $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$
    *   $x^{-a} = \frac{1}{x^a}$
    *   $x^{a/b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}$
*   **Polynomials**:
    *   **Adding/Subtracting**: Combine like terms.
    *   **Multiplying**: FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or Box Method.
*   **Factoring**:
    *   **GCF**: Factor out the greatest common factor first.
    *   **Difference of Squares**: $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$.
    *   **Perfect Square Trinomials**: $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2$.

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Analyze the Options**: Look at the answer choices to see what form they are in (factored, expanded, etc.).
2.  **Apply Operations**:
    *   If expanding: Distribute carefully.
    *   If simplifying: Factor numerator and denominator and cancel common factors.
3.  **Plug in Numbers**: If stuck, pick a simple number for $x$ (like 0, 1, or 2), calculate the value of the original expression, and check which answer choice gives the same value.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **The "Freshman Dream"**: Thinking $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2$. It is **NOT**. It is $x^2 + 2xy + y^2$.
*   **Negative Exponents**: Forgetting that a negative exponent moves the base to the denominator (or numerator if it was already down).
*   **Canceling Terms**: You can only cancel **factors** (things being multiplied), not terms (things being added). $\frac{x+2}{2}$ does NOT equal $x+1$.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: Which expression is equivalent to $(2x^2 + 3x - 5) - (x^2 - x + 2)$?

**Solution**:
1.  **Distribute the Negative**: The second parenthesis has a minus sign in front.
    *   $2x^2 + 3x - 5 - x^2 + x - 2$
2.  **Combine Like Terms**:
    *   $x^2$ terms: $2x^2 - x^2 = x^2$
    *   $x$ terms: $3x + x = 4x$
    *   Constants: $-5 - 2 = -7$
3.  **Answer**: $x^2 + 4x - 7$.
