# Systems of Linear Inequalities

## 1. Overview
A system of linear inequalities involves finding the region where two or more inequalities overlap. Unlike equations where the solution is a point, here the solution is an entire area on the coordinate plane. The DSAT tests your ability to identify this region or determine if a specific point lies within it.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Boundary Lines**:
    *   **Solid Line** ($\le, \ge$): The line itself IS part of the solution.
    *   **Dashed Line** ($<, >$): The line itself IS NOT part of the solution.
*   **Shading**:
    *   $y > ...$ or $y \ge ...$: Shade **ABOVE** the line.
    *   $y < ...$ or $y \le ...$: Shade **BELOW** the line.
*   **Solution Region**: The area where the shaded regions of all inequalities overlap.

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Graph First Inequality**: Draw the line (solid or dashed) and shade lightly.
2.  **Graph Second Inequality**: Draw the line and shade lightly.
3.  **Identify Overlap**: The solution is the area where the shading intersects (the "double-shaded" region).
4.  **Test Points**: If unsure, pick a test point like $(0,0)$. If it makes the inequality true, shade that side.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Boundary Points**: Thinking a point ON a dashed line is a solution. It is not.
*   **Shading Errors**: Getting confused with vertical lines ($x > 3$ is to the right, $x < 3$ is to the left).
*   **Reversing Shading**: Forgetting to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative, leading to shading the wrong side.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: Which quadrant contains no solutions to the system?
$y \ge x + 2$
$y \le -x + 2$

**Solution**:
1.  **Graph $y \ge x + 2$**:
    *   y-intercept at 2, slope 1. Solid line.
    *   Shade **ABOVE** (Top Left).
2.  **Graph $y \le -x + 2$**:
    *   y-intercept at 2, slope -1. Solid line.
    *   Shade **BELOW** (Bottom Left).
3.  **Overlap**: The region is bounded by the two lines and extends to the left.
    *   The solution covers Quadrant II and parts of I and III (on the axes).
    *   The solution region does **not** enter Quadrant IV (Bottom Right).
4.  **Answer**: Quadrant IV.
