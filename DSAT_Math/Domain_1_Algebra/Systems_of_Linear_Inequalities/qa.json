If the question meant y <= 3 and x <= 4, it would be a rectangle (0 to 4 on x, 0 to 3 on y). \nLet's re-read standard DSAT patterns. Usually it asks for area or vertices. \nLet's assume the question implies a bounded region or asks for vertices. \nCorrection for this specific Q/A generation: Let's make it a standard point check or simple region identification. \nLet's change the question to: 'Which quadrant contains NO solutions to the system y >= 2x + 1 and y > -2x + 1?' \nGraphing: y-int is 1 for both. One goes up steep right, one goes down steep right. \nShade above both. This covers top middle (Quad I and II). \nQuad III and IV have no solutions. \nLet's stick to a clearer Hard question: \n'y < 2x + 3 and y > 2x - 4. Which describes the solution region?' \nAnswer: The region between two parallel lines."
