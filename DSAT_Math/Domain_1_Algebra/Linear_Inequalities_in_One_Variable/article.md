# Linear Inequalities in One Variable

## 1. Overview
Linear inequalities are solved almost exactly like linear equations, but instead of finding a single value, you are finding a range of values. The DSAT tests your ability to solve these inequalities and often asks you to identify the solution set or the largest/smallest integer that satisfies the condition.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Symbols**:
    *   $<$ (Less than) and $>$ (Greater than): Open circle on number line.
    *   $\le$ (Less than or equal to) and $\ge$ (Greater than or equal to): Closed/Filled circle on number line.
*   **The Golden Rule**: When you **multiply or divide** both sides of an inequality by a **negative number**, you must **FLIP** the inequality sign.

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Isolate**: Treat the inequality sign like an equals sign. Move variables to one side and constants to the other.
2.  **Solve**: Simplify until you have $x > ...$ or $x < ...$.
3.  **Check the Sign**: Did you multiply/divide by a negative? If yes, flip the sign.
4.  **Graph/Interpret**: If asked, visualize the solution on a number line to ensure you pick the correct range.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **The Flip**: The most common error is forgetting to reverse the inequality symbol when dividing by a negative.
    *   Example: $-2x > 6$ becomes $x < -3$, NOT $x > -3$.
*   **Integer Constraints**: Questions asking for the "largest integer" solution. If $x < 5$, the largest integer is 4, not 5.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: What is the solution to $-3x + 7 \le 19$?

**Solution**:
1.  **Subtract 7**: $-3x \le 12$
2.  **Divide by -3**: Since we are dividing by a negative, **FLIP** the sign.
    *   $x \ge -4$
3.  **Answer**: $x \ge -4$ (or $[-4, \infty)$).
