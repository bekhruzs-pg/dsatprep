# Linear Equations in One Variable

## 1. Overview
Linear equations in one variable are the building blocks of algebra. On the DSAT, these questions test your ability to manipulate algebraic expressions to isolate a variable. While often straightforward, the test introduces complexity through fractions, decimals, and conceptual questions about the number of solutions. Mastery here is essential for speed and accuracy in more complex domains.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Standard Form**: $ax + b = c$ or $ax + b = cx + d$.
*   **Inverse Operations**: Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication/Division are pairs used to "undo" operations.
*   **Number of Solutions**:
    *   **One Solution**: $x = k$ (Constants are different, coefficients of $x$ are different).
    *   **No Solution**: $a = b$ where $a \neq b$ (e.g., $3 = 5$). This happens when coefficients of $x$ match but constants differ. Lines are parallel.
    *   **Infinite Solutions**: $a = a$ (e.g., $5 = 5$). This happens when the equation simplifies to an identity. Lines are identical.

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Simplify**: Distribute any coefficients and combine like terms on each side of the equation.
2.  **Isolate Variable Term**: Move all terms with the variable to one side and constants to the other using addition or subtraction.
3.  **Solve**: Divide or multiply to isolate the variable completely.
4.  **Check**: Plug your answer back into the original equation to verify.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Sign Errors**: Forgetting to distribute a negative sign into parentheses (e.g., $-2(x - 3)$ becoming $-2x - 6$ instead of $-2x + 6$).
*   **Fraction Phobia**: incorrectly clearing fractions or making arithmetic errors with them.
*   **Misinterpreting "No Solution"**: Confusing a result of $x = 0$ (one solution) with $0 = 5$ (no solution).

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: Solve for $x$: $3(2x - 1) - 5 = 4(x + 2) + 2x$

**Solution**:
1.  **Distribute**: $6x - 3 - 5 = 4x + 8 + 2x$
2.  **Combine Like Terms**: $6x - 8 = 6x + 8$
3.  **Move Variables**: Subtract $6x$ from both sides: $-8 = 8$
4.  **Interpret**: Since $-8 \neq 8$, this statement is false.
5.  **Answer**: **No Solution**.
