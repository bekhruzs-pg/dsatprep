        "explanation": "For a linear equation to have no solution, the variable terms must cancel out (coefficients must be equal) while the constants remain different. The coefficient of x on the left is 5. Therefore, k must be 5. This results in 5x - 3 = 5x + 7, which simplifies to -3 = 7, a false statement."
