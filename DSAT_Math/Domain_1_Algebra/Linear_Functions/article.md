# Linear Functions (Two Variables)

## 1. Overview
Linear functions describe a constant rate of change between two variables, usually $x$ and $y$. On the DSAT, you will encounter these as equations, graphs, and word problems. Understanding the slope (rate of change) and y-intercept (starting value) is the key to mastering this topic.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Slope-Intercept Form**: $y = mx + b$
    *   $m$ = Slope (Rise over Run, $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$)
    *   $b$ = y-intercept (Value of $y$ when $x=0$)
*   **Standard Form**: $Ax + By = C$
    *   Slope = $-\frac{A}{B}$
    *   y-intercept = $\frac{C}{B}$
*   **Point-Slope Form**: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
*   **Parallel Lines**: Have the **same** slope ($m_1 = m_2$).
*   **Perpendicular Lines**: Have **negative reciprocal** slopes ($m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$).

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Identify the Goal**: Are you finding the equation, the slope, or a specific point?
2.  **Find the Slope ($m$)**: Use two points or rearrange the equation into $y = mx + b$.
3.  **Find the Intercept ($b$)**: Plug in a known point $(x, y)$ and the slope $m$ into $y = mx + b$ and solve for $b$.
4.  **Interpret Context**: In word problems, "per" or "each" usually indicates slope, while "initial" or "starting" indicates the y-intercept.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Slope Formula Order**: Calculating $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_1 - x_2}$ instead of $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The order must be consistent.
*   **Standard Form Slope**: Forgetting the negative sign when finding slope from $Ax + By = C$ (Slope is $-A/B$, not $A/B$).
*   **Zero vs. Undefined Slope**: Horizontal lines ($y=k$) have slope 0. Vertical lines ($x=k$) have undefined slope.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: A line passes through the points $(2, 5)$ and $(4, 11)$. What is the equation of the line?

**Solution**:
1.  **Find Slope ($m$)**: $\frac{11 - 5}{4 - 2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$. So, $m = 3$.
2.  **Use Slope-Intercept Form**: $y = 3x + b$.
3.  **Find Intercept ($b$)**: Plug in $(2, 5)$:
    *   $5 = 3(2) + b$
    *   $5 = 6 + b$
    *   $b = -1$
4.  **Write Equation**: $y = 3x - 1$.
