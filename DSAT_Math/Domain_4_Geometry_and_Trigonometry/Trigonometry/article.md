# Trigonometry

## 1. Overview
Trigonometry on the DSAT focuses on right triangle ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) and basic unit circle concepts. You'll also encounter radian/degree conversions. These questions test your ability to set up and solve trig ratios in context.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **SOH CAH TOA**:
    *   $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
    *   $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
    *   $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$
*   **Radians vs. Degrees**:
    *   $180° = \pi$ radians
    *   To convert: $\text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \text{Radians}$
    *   To convert: $\text{Radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \text{Degrees}$
*   **Unit Circle Basics**:
    *   $\sin(0) = 0$, $\cos(0) = 1$
    *   $\sin(90°) = 1$, $\cos(90°) = 0$

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Identify the Angle**: Which angle are you working with?
2.  **Label the Sides**: Relative to that angle, which side is opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse?
3.  **Choose the Right Ratio**: Need opposite and hypotenuse? Use sine. Need adjacent and hypotenuse? Use cosine.
4.  **Set up Equation**: Solve for the unknown.
5.  **Desmos**: You can type `sin(30)` or `cos(45)` directly (in degrees or radians).

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Opposite/Adjacent Mix-up**: Always label relative to the **given** angle, not just any angle.
*   **Calculator Mode**: Make sure your calculator is in the correct mode (degrees vs. radians).
*   **Tan = Sin/Cos**: Remember that $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 20 and one angle is $30°$. What is the length of the side opposite the $30°$ angle?

**Solution**:
1.  **Identify**: We have hypotenuse and need opposite. Use **sine**.
2.  **Set up**: $\sin(30°) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{20}$
3.  **Recall**: $\sin(30°) = 0.5$
4.  **Solve**: $0.5 = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{20} \rightarrow \text{Opposite} = 10$
5.  **Answer**: The opposite side is 10.
