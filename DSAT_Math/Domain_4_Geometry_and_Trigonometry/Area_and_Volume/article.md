# Area and Volume

## 1. Overview
This topic tests your ability to calculate area and volume for various shapes: rectangles, triangles, circles, prisms, cylinders, spheres, cones, and pyramids. Memorizing formulas is essential, but understanding when to apply them is just as important.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **2D Shapes (Area)**:
    *   Rectangle: $A = l \times w$
    *   Triangle: $A = \frac{1}{2} b \times h$
    *   Circle: $A = \pi r^2$
*   **3D Shapes (Volume)**:
    *   Rectangular Prism (Box): $V = l \times w \times h$
    *   Cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$
    *   Sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
    *   Cone: $V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$
    *   Pyramid: $V = \frac{1}{3} B \times h$ (where $B$ is the area of the base)
*   **Surface Area**:
    *   Rectangular Prism: $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$
    *   Cylinder: $SA = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$ (two circles + rectangle wrapped around)
    *   Sphere: $SA = 4\pi r^2$

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Identify the Shape**: Is it 2D or 3D? What type?
2.  **Label Dimensions**: Write down all given measurements (length, width, radius, height).
3.  **Choose Formula**: Match the shape to the correct formula.
4.  **Calculate**: Plug in the values and solve.
5.  **Check Units**: Make sure your answer has the correct units (square units for area, cubic units for volume).

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Radius vs. Diameter**: Many questions give diameter but formulas use radius. Remember $r = d/2$.
*   **1/3 Factor**: Cones and pyramids have the $\frac{1}{3}$ factor. Cylinders and prisms do NOT.
*   **Triangle Height**: The height must be **perpendicular** to the base, not just any side.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: A cylinder has a radius of 3 and a height of 10. What is its volume? (Use π ≈ 3.14)

**Solution**:
1.  **Identify**: Cylinder. Use $V = \pi r^2 h$.
2.  **Plug in**: $V = 3.14 \times 3^2 \times 10$
3.  **Calculate**: $V = 3.14 \times 9 \times 10 = 3.14 \times 90 = 282.6$
4.  **Answer**: The volume is approximately 282.6 cubic units.
