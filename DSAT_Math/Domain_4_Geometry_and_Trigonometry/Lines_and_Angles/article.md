# Lines and Angles

## 1. Overview
This topic covers the basic properties of lines and angles: parallel lines cut by transversals, angle relationships (vertical, complementary, supplementary), and properties formed by intersecting lines. These concepts appear as standalone questions or as setups for triangle problems.

## 2. Key Concepts & Formulas
*   **Angle Relationships**:
    *   **Vertical Angles**: Opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines. Always **equal**.
    *   **Complementary**: Two angles that sum to $90°$.
    *   **Supplementary**: Two angles that sum to $180°$ (also called a **linear pair** if adjacent).
*   **Parallel Lines + Transversal**:
    *   **Corresponding Angles**: In the same position. Always **equal**.
    *   **Alternate Interior Angles**: Inside the parallel lines, on opposite sides. Always **equal**.
    *   **Alternate Exterior Angles**: Outside the parallel lines, on opposite sides. Always **equal**.
    *   **Same-Side Interior**: Add up to $180°$ (supplementary).

## 3. Step-by-Step Strategy
1.  **Label Known Angles**: Write down any angles you're given.
2.  **Use Angle Relationships**: Apply vertical, supplementary, or parallel line rules.
3.  **Set up Equations**: If an unknown angle is needed, express it in terms of $x$ and solve.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
*   **Assuming Lines Are Parallel**: Don't assume unless explicitly stated or marked with arrows.
*   **Mixing up Interior/Exterior**: Be careful about which angles are inside vs. outside the parallel lines.

## 5. Example Walkthrough
**Problem**: Two parallel lines are cut by a transversal. One angle measures $120°$. What is the measure of its corresponding angle?

**Solution**:
1.  **Corresponding Angles Rule**: Corresponding angles are equal when lines are parallel.
2.  **Answer**: $120°$.
