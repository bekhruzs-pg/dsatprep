# DSAT Math Roadmap: Path to 800

This roadmap is designed to guide students from their current level to a perfect 800 on the Digital SAT Math section. It is structured to build a strong conceptual foundation, master application, and refine speed and accuracy for the hardest problems.

## 1. The DSAT Math Landscape

### Structure
- **Two Modules**: Adaptive format. Module 1 (Mix of easy/medium/hard) determines the difficulty of Module 2.
- **Time**: 35 minutes per module.
- **Questions**: 22 questions per module (20 operational + 2 pretest).
- **Tools**: Desmos Graphing Calculator is built-in and available for ALL questions.

### The 4 Core Domains
1.  **Algebra** (~35%): Linear equations, inequalities, systems.
2.  **Advanced Math** (~35%): Non-linear equations, quadratics, exponentials, functions.
3.  **Problem-Solving & Data Analysis** (~15%): Ratios, rates, percentages, probability, statistics.
4.  **Geometry & Trigonometry** (~15%): Area, volume, lines, angles, triangles, circles, trig functions.

## 2. Phased Progression Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Concepts & Mechanics)
*Goal: Ensure zero gaps in fundamental mathematical concepts.*
- **Focus**: Re-learning forgotten rules, understanding "why" formulas work.
- **Action**: Go through each subtopic in the Domain Breakdown below.
- **Checkpoint**: Can you explain the concept to someone else without looking at notes?

### Phase 2: Application (Standard Problems)
*Goal: Apply concepts to standard SAT-style questions.*
- **Focus**: Recognizing question types and knowing the standard method to solve them.
- **Action**: Practice drills by topic (untimed).
- **Checkpoint**: >90% accuracy on "Easy" and "Medium" difficulty questions.

### Phase 3: Mastery (Hard Problems & Desmos)
*Goal: Tackle the hardest problems and optimize for speed.*
- **Focus**: "Hard" difficulty questions, multi-step problems, and **Desmos mastery**.
- **Action**: Learn to solve algebraic problems *graphically* to save time.
- **Checkpoint**: >85% accuracy on "Hard" difficulty questions.

### Phase 4: The 800 Push (Speed, Traps, & Optimization)
*Goal: Eliminate careless errors and master the "unsolvable".*
- **Focus**: Time management, identifying trap answers, back-solving, plugging in numbers.
- **Action**: Full-length timed practice tests. Analyze EVERY mistake.
- **Checkpoint**: Consistently scoring 780-800 on practice tests.

    - **Function Notation**: $f(x)$, composite functions $f(g(x))$, transformations (shifts, stretches).

### 🟧 Domain 3: Problem-Solving & Data Analysis (Real World)
*Reading comprehension meets math. Pay attention to units.*

## 4. The "Desmos" Advantage (Secret Weapon)
*For the Digital SAT, Desmos is not just a calculator; it's a solver.*

1.  **System of Equations**: Don't use substitution/elimination. Graph them.
2.  **Function Values**: If asked for $f(5)$, type the function $f(x)$ and then type $f(5)$.
3.  **Regression**: Type a table of values ($x_1, y_1$) and use $y_1 \sim mx_1 + b$ to find the line of best fit.
4.  **Solving Equations**: Graph the left side as $y=...$ and right side as $y=...$. Intersection is the answer.

## 5. Daily Routine for 800
- **Review**: 1 Topic/Day (Phase 1).
- **Practice**: 10-20 Questions/Day (Phase 2).
- **Analyze**: Review every mistake. Why did you miss it? (Concept? Misread? Calculation?).
- **Mock Tests**: 1 Full Test every weekend (Phase 3 & 4).
